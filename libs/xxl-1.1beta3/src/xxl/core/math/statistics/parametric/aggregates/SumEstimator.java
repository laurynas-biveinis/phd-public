/** This class provides an estimator for the aggregation function <TT>SUM</TT>.
 * The expected sum is computed by S_e = size_of_entirety * running_average, i.e.,
 * the totally number of elements must be given in advance.<BR>
 * If the already processed data exceeds the given size of the entirety there are three
 * different strategies available to solve this: <BR>
 * 1. RESTRICTIVE: Throw an IllegalStateException <BR>
 * 3. ADAPTIVE: Adapt the given size of the entirety to the number of already processed data <BR>
 * 3. QUIET: Do nothing <BR>
 * The used strategy is passed to the estimator by an int.
 *
 * <br>
 * <p><b>Objects of this type are recommended for the usage with aggregator cursors!</b></p>
 * <br>
 * Each aggregation function must support a function call of the following type:<br>
 * <tt>agg_n = f (agg_n-1, next)</tt>, <br>
 * where <tt>agg_n</tt> denotes the computed aggregation value after <tt>n</tt> steps,
 * <tt>f</tt> the aggregation function,
 * <tt>agg_n-1</tt> the computed aggregation value after <tt>n-1</tt> steps
 * and <tt>next</tt> the next object to use for computation.
 * An aggregation function delivers only <tt>null</tt> as aggregation result as long as the aggregation
 * function has not yet fully initialized.
 * <br>
 * Objects of this class don't use any internally stored information to obtain the estimated sum, 
 * so one could say objects of this type or 'status-less'.
 * See {@link xxl.core.math.statistics.parametric.aggregates.OnlineAggregation OnlineAggregation} for further details about 
 * aggregation function using internally stored information.
 *
 * Consider the following example:
 * <code><pre>
 * Aggregator aggregator = new Aggregator(
		new RandomIntegers(100, 50), // input-Cursor
		new SumEstimator()			// aggregate function
	);
 * <\code><\pre>
 * <br>
 *
