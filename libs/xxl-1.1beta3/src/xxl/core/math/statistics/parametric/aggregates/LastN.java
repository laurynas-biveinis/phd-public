 * Stores the last 'seen' n objects.
 * <br>
 * <p><b>Objects of this type are recommended for the usage with aggregator cursors!</b></p>
 * <br>
 * Each aggregation function must support a function call of the following type:<br>
 * <tt>agg_n = f (agg_n-1, next)</tt>, <br>
 * where <tt>agg_n</tt> denotes the computed aggregation value after <tt>n</tt> steps,
 * <tt>f</tt> the aggregation function,
 * <tt>agg_n-1</tt> the computed aggregation value after <tt>n-1</tt> steps
 * and <tt>next</tt> the next object to use for computation.
 * An aggregation function delivers only <tt>null</tt> as aggregation result as long as the aggregation
 * function has not yet fully initialized, meaning to this class the first (n-1)-th delivered
 * objects are <tt>null</tt>!
 * 
 * Consider the following example:
 * <code><pre>
 * Aggregator agg = new Aggregator(
		it ,			// input-Cursor
		new LastN( 3)	// aggregate function
	);
 * <\code><\pre>
