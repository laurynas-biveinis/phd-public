/**
 * Computes an estimation of the standard deviation step-by-step on 
 * {@link java.lang.Number numerical data} without any error control
 * using {@link xxl.core.math.statistics.parametric.aggregates.VarianceEstimator}.
 * <br>
 * <p><b>Objects of this type are recommended for the usage with aggregator cursors!</b></p>
 * <br>
 * Each aggregation function must support a function call of the following type:<br>
 * <tt>agg_n = f (agg_n-1, next)</tt>, <br>
 * where <tt>agg_n</tt> denotes the computed aggregation value after <tt>n</tt> steps,
 * <tt>f</tt> the aggregation function,
 * <tt>agg_n-1</tt> the computed aggregation value after <tt>n-1</tt> steps
 * and <tt>next</tt> the next object to use for computation.
 * A aggregation function delivers only <tt>null</tt> as aggregation result as long as the aggregation
 * function has not yet fully initialized.
 * Objects of this type have a two-step phase for initialization.
 * <br>
 * Also objects of this class are using internally stored information to obtain the standard deviation, 
 * objects of this type don't support on-line features.
 * See {@link xxl.core.math.statistics.parametric.aggregates.OnlineAggregation OnlineAggregation} for further details about 
 * aggregation function using internally stored information supporting <tt>on-line aggregation</tt>.
