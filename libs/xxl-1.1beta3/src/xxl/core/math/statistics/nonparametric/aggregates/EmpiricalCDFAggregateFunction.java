/** In the context of online aggregation, running aggregates are built. Given an 
 * iterator of data, an {@link xxl.core.cursors.mappers.Aggregator Aggregator}
 * computes iteratively aggregates. For instance, the current maximum
 * of the already processed data is determined. An internal aggregation function processes
 * the computation of the new element by consuming the old aggregate and the new element
 * from the input cursor.
 * 
 * Generally, each aggregation function must support a function call of the following type:<br>
 * <tt>agg_n = f (agg_n-1, next)</tt>. <br>
 * There, <tt>agg_n</tt> denotes the computed aggregation value after <tt>n</tt> steps,
 * <tt>f</tt> represents the aggregation function,
 * <tt>agg_n-1</tt> the computed aggregation value after <tt>n-1</tt> steps
 * and <tt>next</tt> the next object to use for computation.
 * <br>
 * 
 * This class implements an aggregation function that computes the <tt>empirical cumulative distribution function</tt>. 
 * Given an old and a new sample as processed objects, this function computes the empirical cdf based on the new sample. 
 * <br>
 * Consider the following example that displays a concrete application of a
 * empirical cdf aggregation function combined with an aggregator:
 * <code><pre>
 	Aggregator aggregator =
			new Aggregator(
				new Aggregator( input, mapSamplingStrategy (sampleSize, samplingType)),
				new EmpiricalCDFAggregateFunction()
			);
 * </pre></code>
