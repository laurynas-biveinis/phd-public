 * This interface provides the support for the estimation of range queries respectively

 * <br> 
 * A <tt>range query</tt> is performed on categorical data over an ordinal scale,
 * i.e., a total ordering provided by a {@link java.util.Comparator comparator}

 * <tt>[ l, r)</tt> whereby the left-most object <tt>l</tt> is included and the
 * right-most object <tt>r</tt> is excluded. As an estimation of
 * the <tt>range query<\tt>, a double value is returned.
