	 * <b>Taken from the original java api:</b><br>
	 * The general contract of nextDouble is that one double value,
	 * chosen (approximately) uniformly from the range 0.0d (inclusive)
	 * to 1.0d (exclusive), is pseudorandomly generated and returned.
	 * All 253 possible float values of the form m x 2-53 ,
	 * where m is a positive integer less than 253, are produced
	 * with (approximately) equal probability.
	 * The method nextDouble is implemented by class
	 * {@link java.util.Random Random} as follows: 
	 * <br><br>
	 * <code><pre>
	public double nextDouble() {
	return (((long)next(26) << 27) + next(27))
   		/ (double)(1L << 53);
		}
	 * </code></pre><br>
	 * The hedge "approximately" is used in the foregoing description
	 * only because the next method is only approximately an
	 * unbiased source of independently chosen bits.
	 * If it were a perfect source or randomly chosen bits,
	 * then the algorithm shown would choose double values
	 * from the stated range with perfect uniformity. 
	 * @return the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed
	 * double value between 0.0 and 1.0 from the java random
	 * number generator's sequence.
