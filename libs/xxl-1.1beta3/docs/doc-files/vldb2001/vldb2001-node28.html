In <B>Smalltalk</B> [x], blocks are used to combine
multiple instructions to a logical unit. The creation of a block
is independent of its execution. Therefore blocks can be bound to
variables and explicitly executed at any time. Block arguments can
be used as local variables or input parameters. If the last
instruction on a block returns a result, it is used as the result
of the block. Blocks are used to define conditions and bodies of
loops or conditional expressions as well as they are used for
transmission of special functionality to general algorithms. In
XXL functions are used to implement the functionality of blocks.

A short comprehension between cursors and streams.

<B>Volcano</B> [x] is a dataflow query execution system,
implemented in C, with a special focus on query optimization and
parallelism in database query processing, providing also a testbed
for database systems research like XXL. Volcano and XXL use a
tree-structured query evaluation strategy, represented as algebra
expressions, that is used to execute queries by demand-driven
dataflow (lazy evaluation). Therefore, all algebra operators are
implemented as <I>iterators</I>, i.e., they implement a simple
<I>open-next-close</I> protocol, which is only extended by XXL.
This feature guarantees that iterators can be composed, because an
operator does neither need to know what kind of operator produces
its input nor any information about the type and structure of the
elements contained in the stream. The second parallel is the usage
of <I>support functions</I> with regard to all manipulation and
interpretation of individual data objects contained in these
streams. But XXL has several advantages with regard to Volcano,
since it has been implemented in Java, e.g. the strict type
concept or the platform independence. Furthermore, XXL presents no
stand-alone solution, but an extension of the SDK that delivers a
large standard library and infrastructure combined with high
acceptance. Volcano integrates modules implementing a file system
and a memory manager, so it tends to be a system and no real
library like XXL, where the file input and output stream
interfaces of the SDK are used and the memory management is
controlled by the Java Virtual Machine. XXL supports all kinds of
data-sources like JDBC-databases, files or even URLs, whereas the
connectivity of Volcano is restricted to file I/O. The various
kinds of index structures and a lot of components for spatial
query processing integrated in XXL, but not contained in Volcano,
underline its flexibility, as well as the fact that XXL cannot
only be used for query processing in an object-oriented database
system, but also delivers an implementation of the physical
operators of the relational algebra.

Our work can also be compared with <B>OFL</B> [<A
 HREF="vldb2001-node30.html#GMP95">GMP95</A>].
Gardarin et al proposed an object functional language as a target
language for OQL-like query compilers. The language consists of a
small set of functions that are based on collections. The
functions <I>apply to all</I> and <I>apply to any</I> can be
used to traverse collections. Both functions require a collection,
a predicate, and a function. If an object satisfies the predicate,
the function is called which can perform nested operations. Some
other important OFL-functions are <I>composition</I>,
<I>iteration</I> and <I>sequence</I>. All concepts of OFL are
availlable within the XXL library. The main difference is that XXL
represents the query in form of an operator tree consisting of
cursors. The results of a complex query are delivered by calling
the root cursor's hasNext/next-methods. Contrary to XXL, the
output of OFL queries are delivered by the <I>display</I>
function that is called inside a nested structure. In XXL,
collections are represented by cursors that iterate on specific
sources, e.g. JDBC ResultSets, Files, URL-Connections, and many
more. The <I>apply to all</I> function is equivalent to the
filter cursor which delivers every element that fulfills a defined
predicate. <I>apply to any</I> can be found as a static method
in the class xxl.cursors.Cursors. Functions and predicates already
support composition, and sequence can easily be modeled by putting
the results of functions into an object, e.g. a
java.util.LinkedList.

FQL

<B>TPIE</B> [x], a Transparent Parallel I/O Environment
implemented as a set of templated classes and functions in C++, is
designed to assist programmers in writing high performance
I/O-efficient programs. To achieve this goal the I/O performance
is approved by providing algorithms minimizing the input/output
communication and using parallel disk processing. The details how
I/O is performed is abstracted away by a simple high level
<I>stream interface</I> the programmer deals with. But the
algorithms in TPIE do not implement a cursor interface, i.e., each
algorithm completely consumes all its input data and generates all
output data at once. As a result, the output of an algorithm
cannot be passed on directly to another algorithm, but has to be
stored on and reread from disk before. Therefore it is impossible
to use the algorithms in operator trees or even to stop an
algorithm if only a small fraction of the result set is needed.
The streams used in TPIE are based on an ordered collection of
objects and the operations are limited to a maximum of four input
and four output streams. In contrast to TPIE, XXL handles
arbitrary collections due to the possibility to compose cursors,
no limitation of the number of input cursors are made.
Furthermore, TPIE uses stream-oriented <I>block transfer
engines</I> to move the blocks of data from physical disk devices to
main memory and back. But still no random-access to disk blocks is
supported, which can be effectively used for index-structures.
Like Volcano, TPIE also is not able to use arbitrary data-sources
such as URL input streams, and it represents no traditional
library, because it relies on a memory manager allocating and
managing the physical memory used by the block transfer engine.
This fact also implies that TPIE is not platform independent,
especially the block transfer engine is system and application
dependent. Also a great part of buffering and prefetching is
performed by the system in contrast to XXL, where the buffer and
its strategy are completely application dependent.

<B>LEDA-SM</B> (LEDA -- Secondary Memory) [x] is an
extension of LEDA (Library of Efficient Data types and Algorithms)
[x] towards secondary memory computation. The library works on
block-structured files that represents a collection of disks.
LEDA-SM provides a collection of external memory data structures,
algorithms operating on these data structures and a centralized
kernel that controls memory management on disk or main memory.
LEDA-SM does not provide a cursor interface for accessing external
data structures, which leads to the same disadvantages mentioned
in the section about TPIE. In its current version, LEDA-SM does
not support any index structure. LEDA-SM differs from traditional
libraries by using a centralized kernel for memory management.

<B>STL</B> (Standard Template Library) [x] is a C++
library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. The
library provides a large collection of the basic algorithms and
data structures of computer science. Its components are generic
and mostly templates -- therefore the behavior and functionality
of algorithms and data structures can be adapted by type
parameters. All algorithms and data structures contained in STL
reside in main memory. Therefore they cannot be used for
manipulating large data sets as needed by database applications.
Like LEDA-SM, STL does not support any index structures. Although
the iterator (cursor) concept takes a central part of the library,
its algorithms do not provide lazy evaluation.

<B>GiST</B> unifies a number of popular index structures
and provides a generalized search tree. Though GiST implements a
generalized search algorithm, it does not provide an
infrastructure to process the query results further on. Important
database algorithms, e.g. joins, are not supported in GiST.
