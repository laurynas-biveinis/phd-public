Connectivity to Cloudscape
</H2>

Cloudscape&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="vldb2001-node30.html#Cloudscape">Inf01</A>], a commercial DBMS of Informix, 
is a Java- and SQL-based object-relational database management system, written 
in 100% pure Java. It can directly be embedded in a Java application, or used 
in a classical client-server or Web-server mode. Data access is realized via SQL-92E 
calls by using the standard Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) protocol. Cloudscape 
extends this functionality by the feature to store arbitrary serializable Java 
objects. In that way, it is possible to define an attribute of a table directly 
as a Java data type. Physically the Java object is stored in its byte format. 
However, when the Java object is read from and written into the database, it is 
automatically deserialized and serialized, respectively. Furthermore, Java is 
used for implementing stored procedures and triggers. XXL communicates with Cloudscape 
in two directions. The first and more obvious direction is accessing the DBMS 
via JDBC calls and SQL statements. This functionality guarantees that XXL is able 
to create, drop and alter tables as well as to evaluate queries on tables. Executed 
SELECT statements return a <I>ResultSet</I> (see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="vldb2001-node10.html#ResultSet">3.5</A>) 
whose rows are consumed by XXL's <I>ResultSetCursor</I>. Each output object of 
this cursor is created by calling a user-defined function on each row. Therefore, 
XXL processes arbitrary objects of the interface <I>ResultSet</I> in a demand-driven 
fashion and provides a smooth integration of them into the cursor algebra. The 
second direction refers to the feature of Cloudscape that a <I>ResultSet</I> can 
directly be used in the FROM clause of a SQL statement. This is also termed the 
<I>Virtual Table Interface (VTI)</I>. As far as the other parts of the SQL statement 
are concerned, there is no difference between an ordinary table and an object 
satisfying VTI. This feature is beneficial for a seamless integration of external 
functionality into the DBMS. In particular, it is very appealing to XXL since 
an operator tree is able to deliver its results wrapped as a <I>ResultSet</I>. 
Currently, there is still the limitation that the FROM clause only accepts a constructor 
call of a <I>ResultSet</I> that makes it difficult to use a previously created 
<I>ResultSet</I>. Moreover, VTI only accepts those constructors with primitive 
parameter types. In order to alleviate these deficiencies, XXL provides the class 
<I>VirtualTable</I> which is a proxy for an object of the interface <I>ResultSet</I>. 
An example of an SQL statement employing the VTI is given by: 
<PRE>
    SELECT Emp.Name
    FROM NEW VirtualTable() AS Emp
    WHERE Emp.Salary &gt; 100000
</PRE>
As shown in our example, attributes of a virtual table are treated
like attributes of an ordinary table. In comparison to the
overhead of implementing data blades, this is a very convenient
way to integrate arbitrary data sources and user-defined
functionality.

Currently, XXL is limited to read-only virtual tables. In the
future XXL will also allow read-write access with the intention to
support INSERT and DELETE statements based on virtual tables.
Furthermore, a generic wrapper will be developed that transforms a
cursor into a <I>ResultSet</I> by adding meta data information.
Therefore, XXL will offer the possibility to integrate data from a
variety of sources into a Cloudscape database as well as to handle
these sources in SQL statements.
