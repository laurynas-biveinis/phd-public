Introduction</A>
</H1>

Since the last decade object-relational DBMS have been emerged in
order to support new application areas where complex data has to
be managed in a user-suitable way. Today's DBMS provide different
mechanisms to incorporate new functionality into the systems. In
general, DBMS vendors offer specific languages which allow the
implementation of user-defined functionality. Recently, they also
support user-defined functionality being implemented directly in
Java. This code can be reasonably fast since Java Virtual Machines
(JVM) are part of the kernel of most DBMS. It seems that this
approach is very appealing to users of DBMS and therefore, we
expect an increase of its practical relevance in the near future.

In this paper, we address the problem of designing a Java library
that facilitates the implementation of user-defined functionality.
As our approach to this problem we present XXL (eXtensible and
fleXible Library). XXL is freely available under the terms of the
GNU Lesser General Public License [<A
 HREF="vldb2001-node30.html#xxldocu">Dat01</A>]. The library
consists of the following components:

<OL>
<LI>The cursor package provides an algebra of the most important
      query operators whose implementations  are demand-driven
      whenever it is effective. The operators of the algebra require
      that the input as well as the output satisfy an iterator
      interface. In order to support the import of external
      database sources, XXL also contains an enriched algebra
      based on Java's interface <I>ResultSet</I>.
      Moreover, some database vendors&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="vldb2001-node30.html#Cloudscape">Inf01</A>] have extended SQL in such a way
      that a <I>ResultSet</I> can be used within a SQL statement. This allows
      a seamless and easy integration of application code into SQL.
</LI>
<LI>XXL offers a rich infrastructure of external data structures
      which are helpful for the implementation of new database functionality. In
      addition, XXL provides a very flexible
      buffer mechanism. In contrast to system-based approaches, specific data
      structures of XXL like the buffer can be used
      without knowledge of the other parts of XXL.
</LI>
<LI>A broad class of index structures has been implemented as a framework in XXL,
      where many default implementations (R-tree, M-tree, X-tree)
      already exist and the implementations of new structures are
      largely facilitated. For example, different types of bulk
      operations on indexes are already efficiently implemented as part
      of the generic code. Moreover, the framework of index
      structures in XXL is not an isolated component, but is fully
      embedded into the library.
</LI>
</OL>
There is another purpose of XXL that is of great importance at least from a research 
point of view. We propose XXL as a library for conducting experiments. Results 
obtained from experiments are important indicators for evaluating the performance 
of new query processing techniques. We however feel that the quality of the experimental 
work has to be considerably improved. Due to the large gap between a high-level 
algorithmic description and a low-level implementation, we argue that in addition 
to the publication of the results, the code should be made publicly available, 
too. However, we assume that the quality of the code is generally poor. Therefore, 
a well documented and open library like XXL would be an ideal infrastructure for 
experiments. The library could provide reference implementations as well as building 
blocks (e.g. external algorithms and data structures) that are used in an experimental 
comparison of competitive approaches. Research in the database area is largely 
driven by the idea of building a system, whereas the development of a library 
is exceptional. Volcano&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="vldb2001-node30.html#Gra94">Gra94</A>] is probably the work closest to 
ours. It provides a data model independent query processing functionality similar 
to XXL, but also addresses the problem of query optimization and parallelism. 
Volcano can be viewed as a hybrid between a system and a library. Iterator-based 
processing is also addressed in object-oriented query languages like OFL&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="vldb2001-node30.html#GMP95">GMP95</A>] and functional ones [<A
 HREF="vldb2001-node30.html#BF79">BF79</A>]. According to indexing, there has 
been only a few approaches. The grid-file system&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="vldb2001-node30.html#Hin85">Hin85</A>] is an exceptional example of an 
elegant implementation of an index structure, but it is limited to one specific 
structure. GIST&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="vldb2001-node30.html#HNP95">HNP95</A>] is basically an extensible system 
for indexing which supports the implementation of R-trees and related structures. 
The development of libraries is more popular in the algorithmic area. There is 
also an increasing interest on external problems where the data cannot be kept 
in main memory. TPIE&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="vldb2001-node30.html#VV96">VV96</A>] and Leda-SM&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="vldb2001-node30.html#CM99">AC99</A>] are among the most well known libraries 
with a rich source of external algorithms. However, both libraries do not support 
demand-driven query processing as it is required in a DBMS. Moreover, index structures 
are not supported in the libraries. The paper is organized as follows. In Section&nbsp;<A HREF="vldb2001-node2.html#Functions">2</A>, 
the implementation of the functional paradigm is outlined. In Section&nbsp;<A HREF="vldb2001-node3.html#Cursors">3</A>, 
the cursor algebra of XXL is introduced. A selection of the most important operators 
is presented and, it is shown how the functionality of a cursor can be extended 
to satisfy the interface <I>java.sql.ResultSet</I>. In Section&nbsp;4, the different 
collections currently available in XXL are presented. The I/O infrastructure including 
buffering and different types of containers is discussed in Section&nbsp;5. XXL's 
framework of index structures is presented in Section&nbsp;6. Section&nbsp;7 discusses 
the most important features of the spatial package. In Section&nbsp;8, we present 
two use-cases of XXL where the one shows the connectivity of XXL and a commercial 
database system and the other presents approaches to spatial databases. Finally, 
Section&nbsp;9 concludes the paper.
