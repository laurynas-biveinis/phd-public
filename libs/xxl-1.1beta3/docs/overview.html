  <p>XXL is a flexible, high-level, platform independent Java-library for data
  processing and database purposes.<br>
  XXL provides a powerful collection of easy-to-use index-structures, 
  query operators and algorithms facilitating the performance evaluation of new 
  query processing developments.&nbsp;Query algorithms in XXL use the same set of basic 
  classes, like I/O routines and improved (de)serialization methods.&nbsp;Therefore, 
  XXL is an ideal testbed for experimental comparisons of new approaches to established 
  ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>: XXL is <a href=http://www.gnu.org>GNU</a> (<a href=doc-files/LGPL.txt>LGPL</a>:
    Lesser Gnu Public License, i.e., XXL can be 
    used in commercial projects.&nbsp;Projects that make use of XXL do not have to 
    be GNU!)<br>

<p>Since the last decade object-relational DBMS have been emerged 
  in order to support new application areas where complex data has to be managed 
  in a user-suitable way. Today's DBMS provide different mechanisms to incorporate 
  new functionality into the systems. In general, DBMS vendors offer specific 
  languages which allow the implementation of user-defined functionality. Recently, 
  they also support user-defined functionality being implemented directly in Java. 
  This code can be reasonably fast since Java Virtual Machines (JVM) are part 
  of the kernel of most DBMS. It seems that this approach is very appealing to 
  users of DBMS and therefore, we expect an increase of its practical relevance 
  in the near future. Here we address the problem of designing a Java library 
  that facilitates the implementation of user-defined functionality. As our approach 
  to this problem we present XXL (eXtensible and fleXible Library). XXL is freely 
  available under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License [Dat01]. 
  The library consists of the following components: <br>
  The cursor package provides an algebra of the most important query operators 
  whose implementations are demand-driven whenever it is effective. The operators 
  of the algebra require that the input as well as the output satisfy an iterator 
  interface. In order to support the import of external database sources, XXL 
  also contains an enriched algebra based on Java's interface ResultSet. Moreover, 
  some database vendors [Inf01] have extended SQL in such a way that a ResultSet 
  can be used within a SQL statement. This allows a seamless and easy integration 
  of application code into SQL. <br>
  XXL offers a rich infrastructure of external data structures which are helpful 
  for the implementation of new database functionality. In addition, XXL provides 
  a very flexible buffer mechanism. In contrast to system-based approaches, specific 
  data structures of XXL like the buffer can be used without knowledge of the 
  other parts of XXL. <br>
  A broad class of index structures has been implemented as a framework in XXL, 
  where many default implementations (R-tree, M-tree, X-tree) already exist and 
  the implementations of new structures are largely facilitated. For example, 
  different types of bulk operations on indexes are already efficiently implemented 
  as part of the generic code. Moreover, the framework of index structures in 
  XXL is not an isolated component, but is fully embedded into the library. <br>
  There is another purpose of XXL that is of great importance at least from a 
  research point of view. We propose XXL as a library for conducting experiments. 
  Results obtained from experiments are important indicators for evaluating the 
  performance of new query processing techniques. We however feel that the quality 
  of the experimental work has to be considerably improved. Due to the large gap 
  between a high-level algorithmic description and a low-level implementation, 
  we argue that in addition to the publication of the results, the code should 
  be made publicly available, too. However, we assume that the quality of the 
  code is generally poor. Therefore, a well documented and open library like XXL 
  would be an ideal infrastructure for experiments. The library could provide 
  reference implementations as well as building blocks (e.g. external algorithms 
  and data structures) that are used in an experimental comparison of competitive 
  approaches. Research in the database area is largely driven by the idea of building 
  a system, whereas the development of a library is exceptional. Volcano [Gra94] 
  is probably the work closest to ours. It provides a data model independent query 
  processing functionality similar to XXL, but also addresses the problem of query 
  optimization and parallelism. Volcano can be viewed as a hybrid between a system 
  and a library. Iterator-based processing is also addressed in object-oriented 
  query languages like OFL [GMP95] and functional ones [BF79]. According to indexing, 
  there has been only a few approaches. The grid-file system [Hin85] is an exceptional 
  example of an elegant implementation of an index structure, but it is limited 
  to one specific structure. GIST [HNP95] is basically an extensible system for 
  indexing which supports the implementation of R-trees and related structures. 
  The development of libraries is more popular in the algorithmic area. There 
  is also an increasing interest on external problems where the data cannot be 
  kept in main memory. TPIE [VV96] and Leda-SM [AC99] are among the most well 
  known libraries with a rich source of external algorithms. However, both libraries 
  do not support demand-driven query processing as it is required in a DBMS. Moreover, 
  index structures are not supported in the libraries.</p>
