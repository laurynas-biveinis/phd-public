XXL INSTALLATION
================

There is no automatic installation procedure available for XXL yet.
Nevertheless the installation procedure is quite simple.

To install XXL on your system do the following:

(1) First extract the archive shipping XXL to a folder of your choice.
(2) Then create a new folder for the output files (e.g., class files, jars ,...)
    generated by XXL (e.g., /usr/name/lang/xxl.out)
(3) Now create two new environment variables:
	(a) XXLROOTPATH pointing to 'extracting-path'/xxl (points to the directory that contains this "INSTALL.txt")
	(b) XXLOUTPATH pointing to the folder created in step (2)

	--- Optional steps ---

	(Opt) The scripts shipped with XXL make use of three additional environment variables:

		(a) XXLJAVAHOME pointing to the installation directory of the 
		    JAVA SDK you will use (at least SDK 1.4).
		    If the java 'bin' folder is in your path you only need to do this,
		    if you want to 'switch' between different versions of the
		    JAVA SDK (e.g. XXLJAVAHOME=/local/jdk or XXLJAVAHOME=c:\lang\java\1.4)
		(b) XXLCLASSPATH indicates where generated class files will be stored
		    (compiling) and where class files are assumed to be found (executing).
		    If this variable is not set, XXL will automatically use %XXLOUTPATH%\class
		(c) XXLSOURCEPATH indicates where java will find the source files.
		    If this variable is not set, XXL will automatically use %XXLROOTPATH%\src.

	    The latter two variables only need to be set if one will use different folders as
	    recommended. USE WITH CAUTION!

(4) Add the path %XXLROOTPATH%/bin/win to your PATH variable for Windows, respectively
	$XXLROOTPATH/bin/linux for Linux
(5) Call 'xxlInit'. This script will create necessary subfolders in %XXLOUTPATH%.


Have fun!
